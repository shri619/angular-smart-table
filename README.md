# angular-smart-table
Smart table is an Angularjs module to easily display data in a table with a set of built in features such filtering,sorting, etc in a declarative way. While developing this module I made sure to focus on these particular points:      lightweight: smart-table is less than 4kb minified and has no dependencies other than Angular itself. And you can even reduce its size with a custom build if you are not interested in some of the plugins.     robust: smart-table is widely tested which makes the module really stable     modular and extensible: The core features can be accessed with the controller API which is created by the top level directive. Then a set of directives (plugins) allow you to compose you table behavior in a declarative way.     developer friendly: the design of the module has been thought carefully and it is really easy to get into the source code to modify/customise the module to best fit your needs.
